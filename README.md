## 🚀 Getting Started: How to Use

Running these algorithms is straightforward! You'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional but Recommended):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KishoreMuruganantham/Cryptography-and-Network-Security-.git
    cd Cryptography-and-Network-Security-
    ```

2.  **Compile the Java Files:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing the desired `.java` file and compile it using:
    ```bash
    javac FileName.java
    ```
    *(Replace `FileName.java` with the actual file name, e.g., `javac caesar.java`)*

3.  **Run the Compiled Code:**
    After successful compilation, execute the Java class with:
    ```bash
    java FileName
    ```
    *(Replace `FileName` with the class name, e.g., `java caesar`)*

    💡 **Pro Tip:** Some programs might require specific command-line arguments or interactive user input. Always check the source code comments for any special instructions or usage examples!
